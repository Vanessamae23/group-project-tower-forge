# TowerForge

TowerForge is a strategic tower defense game set in a fictional world where players must defend their fortress from waves of enemy invaders. Players strategically place various towers along the enemy's path to destroy them before they breach the fortress gates and lose. As the game progresses, players earn game points to place more fortresses or summon more units and unlock to fend off increasingly challenging waves of enemies.
